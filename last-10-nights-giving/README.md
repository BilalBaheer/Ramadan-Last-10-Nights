## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure

### Data Flow

4. Components re-render with updated information
5. Data is persisted to localStorage

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/last-10-nights-giving.git

## üöÄ Usage

### Making a Quick Donation
1. Navigate to the Quick Donation tab
2. Select a charity and cause
3. Enter donation amount
4. Complete the donation form
5. Confirm your donation

### Scheduling Donations

### Tracking External Donations

5. The donation will be tracked and added to your history when confirmed

## üåê External Donation Tracking

The platform includes a sophisticated system for tracking donations made directly on charity websites:

### How It Works
1. **Tracking ID Generation**: When a user clicks on an external charity link, the system generates a unique tracking ID.
2. **UTM Parameters**: The charity URL is appended with UTM parameters containing the tracking ID.
3. **User Input**: Users can input their planned donation amount before visiting the charity website.
4. **Webhook Simulation**: The system simulates webhook callbacks from charity platforms to confirm donations.
5. **Donation Confirmation**: Confirmed external donations are added to the user's donation history.

### Implementation Details
- `trackExternalDonation()`: Generates tracking IDs and UTM parameters
- `processWebhookCallback()`: Handles confirmation of external donations
- `ExternalDonationTracker`: Displays pending and confirmed external donations
- Local storage is used to maintain pending donation state

## üìÖ Donation Scheduling

The scheduling system allows users to plan their donations for specific nights:

### Features
- Schedule donations for any of the last 10 nights
- Set different amounts for each night
- Receive email reminders
- Automatic processing on the scheduled date
- Customizable notification times

### Implementation
- Uses localStorage to persist scheduled donations
- Simulates a backend service for processing scheduled donations
- Provides a visual calendar interface for easy scheduling
- Integrates with EmailJS for sending reminders

## üìß Email Notification System

The platform includes a comprehensive email notification system to keep users informed about their donations:

### Features
- **Confirmation Emails**: Sent immediately when a donation is scheduled
- **Nightly Reminders**: Automatically sent during each of the last 10 nights of Ramadan
- **Customizable Timing**: Users can select their preferred reminder time
- **Email Testing**: Admin interface to test email templates and delivery

### Implementation Details
- **EmailJS Integration**: Uses EmailJS service for reliable email delivery without a backend
- **Template-Based Emails**: Customized templates for different notification types
- **Scheduled Reminders**: Intelligent scheduling system that sends emails at the right time
- **Email Templates**:
  - Confirmation template: Includes donation details, charity information, and schedule
  - Reminder template: Night-specific reminders with donation amount and charity information

### How It Works
1. When a user schedules a donation, they provide their email address and preferred reminder time
2. The system sends an immediate confirmation email with donation details
3. The reminder service schedules emails for each of the last 10 nights (March 22-31, 2025)
4. At the specified time on each night, users receive a reminder email with that night's donation details
5. Administrators can test both email types through the DonationEmailViewer component
